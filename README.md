# blog_aggregator

## Prerequisites

You'll need [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed. Use the links to download and install them. Once installed, you can confirm:

- Postgres is running by typing `psql --version` in your terminal.
- Go is installed by typing `go version`.

## Installation

Install the `gator` CLI globally with this command:

```bash
go install github.com/realquiller/blog_aggregator@latest
```

This places the CLI in your $GOPATH/bin directory (or $HOME/go/bin by default).
Ensure this directory is in your terminal's PATH to use gator from anywhere.
